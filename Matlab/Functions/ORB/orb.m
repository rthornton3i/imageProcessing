% MATLAB implementation of Oriented FAST rotated BRIEF (ORB)

%   Inputs - im : input image
%            npts: number of ORB feature points to be extracted (default
%            500)
%            scale : a vector of image scales (ORB is not scale invariant,
%            so ORB needs to be computed from different scales of the input
%            image
%           
%   Outputs - cnr : the coordinates of ORB features
%             br  : BRIEF feature descriptor corresponding to ORB features;
